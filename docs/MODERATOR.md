# SHS Family Feud – Moderator Instructions

Welcome! As the **Moderator**, you help the Host keep the game running smoothly. You’re part referee, part timekeeper, and part cheerleader — keeping everyone on track and making sure the rounds flow well.

No tech experience needed — just focus on pacing, fairness, and energy.

## 🎯 Your Core Responsibilities

* **Track time** during the Bonus Round (and keep an eye on pacing in normal rounds)
* **Monitor buzz-ins** — confirm who buzzed first if there’s confusion (coordinate with **Tech Support** if it’s unclear)
* **Count X’s** (wrong answers) and remind the Host when a team reaches 3
* **Judge close answers** (e.g., “Take a walk” vs “Go for a walk”)
* **Manage Steals**:

  * After 3 X’s, make sure all teams write down their steal guess
  * Confirm which team got the highest remaining correct answer
  * If no team gets a correct guess, the original team keeps their points
* **Track the Bonus Round timer** (20 seconds per player)
* Help the Host and Sara stay synced for tallying points and announcing totals

---

## ⏱ Timing and Flow

* Let the Host know if rounds are going **too long** or **too short**
* Keep the pace consistent — each normal round should take 3–5 minutes
* For the Bonus Round:

  * Use a stopwatch or phone timer
  * Give a 5-second warning near the end
  * Call “Time!” when the limit hits

## ⚡ During the Game

### Normal Rounds

* Confirm the first team that buzzed in (prompt **Tech Support** to confirm if the display helps)
* Record each wrong answer (X)
* If a question is tough, recommend giving a 4th X before switching to steals
* Confirm if answers are “close enough” to count
* If the Host cues a reveal and **Tech Support** misses it, prompt Tech Support to click
* Support the Host in keeping things light and moving along

### Bonus Round

* Start and stop the timer for each player (20 seconds each). Timers are set in the uploaded `FamilyFeudSHS.json`; if a separate timer is needed, keep time on your phone.
* Enforce the “no duplicate answers” rule — if repeated, prompt the Host to ask for a new one
* **Tech Support** controls reveals at the end of the round
* Ensure a designated scribe is writing down each player's answers so Tech Support can enter them immediately after each run
* Help the Host confirm scoring at the end

---

## 🧾 End of Each Round

1. Confirm how many points the team earned
2. Double-check the total with Sara before announcing
3. Encourage the Host to celebrate the team’s win or strong effort

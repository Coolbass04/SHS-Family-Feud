# SHS Family Feud – Moderator Instructions

Welcome! As the **Moderator**, you're the behind-the-scenes force that helps the game flow smoothly. Think of yourself as part **timekeeper**, part **vibes manager**, and part **referee**. You’ll help the Host stay on track and use good judgment when questions or answers get tricky.

No technical skills required — just pay attention and speak up when needed!

---

## 🧭 What You’ll Be Doing

* Watch the time and **let the Host know** if:

  * They’re going too fast and can slow down to let teams chat a little more
  * They’re going too long and need to keep it moving
* Track how many **incorrect guesses** a team has (Xs)

  * Normally teams get **3 Xs**, but if the question is hard, the Host may allow **4 Xs** — you can recommend this too
* Help decide if **an answer is “close enough”** to count

  * Example: “Going for a walk” vs. “Take a walk” = ✅
  * Let the Host know if you feel something should count
* During steal attempts:

  * Make sure all 3 non-active teams write down their **one answer**
  * Check their answers and confirm which one (if any) is correct
  * If multiple teams guessed a correct answer, the **team with the highest remaining point value** wins the steal
* During Fast Money:

  * Listen for **duplicate answers** — they are **not allowed**
  * Alert the Host if a duplicate is given so they can prompt for a new answer
* Be the calm brain when things get chaotic ✨

## 🧠 Judgment Calls Are Yours

This is not a rigid game — it’s meant to be fun. If something seems close enough, call it. If a team’s struggling, recommend an extra X. If people are dragging, suggest a skip.

You have full permission to:

* Allow grace on phrasing
* Combine similar answers if it makes sense
* Help the Host keep things light, fair, and moving

## 🕐 Sample Phrases You Might Use

* “That’s their third X — one more or do we let them keep going?”
* “Let’s call that close enough.”
* “Hey Host — we’ve been on this one a while, maybe time to move to the next?”
* “That's a repeat answer — give them another guess.”
* “All three teams wrote down their guesses — Team 3 got the top remaining answer, they steal the points.”

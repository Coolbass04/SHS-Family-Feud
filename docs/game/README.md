# SHS Department Game: Family Feud Style

Welcome to the SHS Department Game Show Documentation! This repository is designed to make it easy for anyone on the team to run our Friendly Feud-style department bonding game using the open-source platform [Friendly Feud](https://www.famf.app/docs/en/help).

Whether you're hosting, moderating, or supporting behind the scenes, these simple Markdown guides will walk you through exactly what you need to do.

## Overview
- **Game Format:** We are using [Friendly Feud](https://www.famf.app) — a free, web-based game show tool inspired by Family Feud.
- **Rounds:** Six questions are pre-loaded. Depending on time, the host may choose to play just 3 or up to all 6.
- **Teams:** There will be **4 teams**. Steals are handled in a way that lets **each non-guessing team write down their answer** — if any team gets the **highest remaining correct answer**, they earn the points.
- **Roles:**
  - [Host](./HOST_INSTRUCTIONS.md) – Leads the game and reveals answers
  - [Game Runner](./GAME_RUNNER.md) – Operates the Friendly Feud platform
  - [Moderator](./MODERATOR.md) – Manages time, tone, and judgment calls
  - [Scorekeeper (Optional)] – Helps track team points if not using auto-scoring

## Files Included
- `HOST_INSTRUCTIONS.md` – Clear step-by-step guide for the host (with rules & FAQs)
- `GAME_RUNNER.md` – Setup and controls for whoever is operating the game interface
- `MODERATOR.md` – Timekeeping, answer interpretation, and pacing guide
- `QUESTION_ANSWER_REFERENCE.md` – Full list of questions and their tabulated answers with scores
- `shs_game.csv` – CSV version of the game (to import into Friendly Feud)

## Key Info
- All scoring is based on real SHS staff answers from an internal survey.
- Points are scaled to add up to ~100 per question to match Family Feud gameplay.
- This game is designed to be fun, low-pressure, and easy to run — no prior experience needed!

# SHS Family Feud – Game Runner Instructions

You’re the person making the game happen on screen! You’ll be in charge of loading the questions into the Friendly Feud website and clicking to reveal answers as the host calls them out.

This guide will walk you through:
- How to set up the game
- How to run the game during the meeting
- What to click (and when!)

You do **not** need to speak or be on camera — this is a behind-the-scenes tech role.

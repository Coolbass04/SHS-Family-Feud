## üèÅ Game Setup

1. Divide the group into **4 teams**.
2. Assign a **Host**, a **Moderator**, and **Tech Support**.
3. Make sure the **egg buzzers** are working.
4. **Tech Support** loads the Friendly Feud game (use `FamilyFeudSHS.json`) and manages the two windows (TV = Game Screen, Laptop = Host Controls).
5. The Moderator should have a timer (for bonus round) and a copy of the printed Q&A sheet.

---

## üîî Normal Round Flow

1. **Show the question.** Teams get ready to buzz in.
2. The **first team to buzz** gives an answer.
3. If that answer is the **top answer**, they choose to **play or pass**.
4. If no one hits the top answer, the team with the **highest remaining answer** plays.
5. The **playing team** then continues guessing until they either:

   * Guess all the answers ‚úÖ, or
   * Get **3 X‚Äôs** ‚ùå (3 wrong answers).
6. After 3 X‚Äôs, **other teams each write down one steal guess.**
7. If a stealing team‚Äôs guess matches a remaining answer, they win the round‚Äôs points.

   * If no steal guess matches, **the original team keeps their points.**
8. **Tech Support reveals answers when the Host calls them.** At the end of the round, **Sara tallies the points** and announces:

   * The round‚Äôs total points
   * Which team currently leads

## ‚ö° Bonus Round Flow

1. Two players (one from each team finalist, or from the same team) answer 5 quick questions.
2. **Tech Support** clicks the **Final Round** button to start each player's run.
3. Timers come from the uploaded `FamilyFeudSHS.json`. If a separate timer is needed, the **Moderator** keeps time on a phone.
4. Designate a **scribe** to write down each player's answers as they speak; do not enter during the timer.
5. When time ends, **Tech Support** enters the scribed answers into Friendly Feud; repeat for player 2.
6. Duplicate answers are not allowed. If repeated, the Host prompts for a new one.
7. Reveal points at the end.

## üß† Scoring

* Each answer is worth its assigned points.
* The Host (or Moderator) records totals each round.

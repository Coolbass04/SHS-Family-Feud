## 🧩 Key Terms

* **Round:** A single question played start to finish.
* **Buzz-In:** The moment teams press their buzzer to answer first.

## 🔔 Normal Round Flow

1. **Show the question.** Teams get ready to buzz in.
2. The **first team to buzz** gives an answer.
3. If that answer is the **top answer**, they choose to **play or pass**.
4. If no one hits the top answer, the team with the **highest remaining answer** plays.
5. The **playing team** then continues guessing until they either:

   * Guess all the answers ✅, or
   * Get **3 X’s** ❌ (3 wrong answers).
6. After 3 X’s, **other teams each write down one steal guess.**
7. If a stealing team’s guess matches a remaining answer, they win the round’s points.

   * If no steal guess matches, **the original team keeps their points.**
8. At the end of the round, **Sara tallies the points** and announces:

   * The round’s total points
   * Which team currently leads

---

## ⚡ Bonus Round Flow

1. Two players (one from each team finalist, or from the same team) answer 5 quick questions.
2. The **Moderator** keeps time — usually 20 seconds per player.
3. Duplicate answers are not allowed. If repeated, the Host prompts for a new one.
4. Points are revealed at the end.

---

## 🧠 Scoring

* Each answer is worth its assigned points.
* The Host (or Moderator) records totals each round.
* The **Moderator** helps confirm similar answers.

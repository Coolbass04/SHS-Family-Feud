# SHS Family Feud – Host Instructions

Welcome! You’ve been chosen to host the SHS Family Feud–style department game — thank you! Don’t worry if you’ve never done this before — this guide will walk you through everything step-by-step.

This is a low-pressure, fun way to connect with your teammates. You don’t need to know tech or be a game show pro — just keep the energy up and help folks have fun.

## 🎤 What You’re Doing as the Host

You are both the **game leader** and the **game runner.** You will:

* Display and control the [Friendly Feud](https://www.famf.app) game on the TV.
* Read each question out loud.
* Manage buzz-ins and keep track of which team goes first.
* Work with the **Moderator** to manage timing, handle judgment calls, and ensure points are tallied.
* Keep the energy fun and positive.

## ⚙️ Setup Before Starting

1. Open [https://www.famf.app](https://www.famf.app) on your laptop.
2. Load the `shs_game.csv` or `FamilyFeudSHS.json` file.
3. Connect your laptop to the TV or projector.
4. Test the **egg buzzers** — make sure they clearly show which team buzzes first.
5. Have the **Moderator** ready with a timer and printed question sheet.

## 🏁 How the Normal Rounds Work

Each round follows this order:

### 1. Show the Question

Read the question on screen and give teams a moment to get ready. Once you finish reading, the **buzzers are live.**

### 2. Buzz-In

The first team to buzz gets to answer.

* If their answer is the **top answer**, they can **choose to play or pass.**
* If it’s not the top answer, go to the next team to buzz.
* If all teams have buzzed, the team with the **highest-ranking answer** plays.

### 3. Playing the Board

The playing team tries to guess the remaining answers on the board.

* Each wrong answer earns an **X**.
* Three X’s = turn over.

### 4. Stealing

After 3 X’s, each of the other teams writes down **one steal guess.**

* If a steal guess matches a remaining answer → that team **wins the round’s points.**
* If no team gets a correct steal → the **original playing team keeps their points.**

### 5. End of Round

After the round:

* Reveal any unrevealed answers.
* **Sara tallies the total points** for that round.
* Announce which team won the round and the updated totals.

## ⚡ Bonus Round

The Bonus Round is faster-paced and can be played at the end.

1. Choose two players (either from one team or the two leading teams).
2. The **Moderator** starts the timer — 20 seconds per player.
3. You will ask **5 quick questions** (from the bonus section of the question sheet).
4. Duplicate answers are **not allowed** — if a player repeats, tell them to try again.
5. At the end, reveal points for all 5 answers.
6. The Moderator or Host tallies totals and announces the winner.

## 🧠 Things to Watch For

### Normal Rounds

* Similar answers (e.g., “Take a walk” vs “Go for a walk”) — count as correct.
* If all teams miss the steal, the playing team always keeps the points.
* Always have the Moderator confirm time and fairness calls.

### Bonus Round

* Duplicate answers → not allowed (ask for a new one).
* Moderator keeps the timer.
* Host reveals answers at the end.

## 🧾 End-of-Round Recap

After every question:

* Confirm the total points earned for that round.
* Ask **Sara** to tally and announce the cumulative totals.
* Keep the energy fun — celebrate each team’s progress!

## 🎉 Hosting Tips

* Keep it lighthearted — humor and cheering are encouraged.
* Read clearly and keep the pace moving.
* Use the Moderator’s cues on whether to move faster or slow down.
* If there’s confusion, pause and check the printed reference.

At the end of the game, announce:

* The **total points** for each team.
* The **winning team**.
* And finish with, “Thanks for playing SHS Family Feud!” 🎊

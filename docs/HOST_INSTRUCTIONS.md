# SHS Family Feud – Host Instructions

Welcome! You’ve been chosen to host the SHS Family Feud–style department game — thank you! Don’t worry if you’ve never done this before — this guide will walk you through everything step-by-step.

This is a low-pressure, fun way to connect with your teammates. You don’t need to know tech or be a game show pro — just keep the energy up and help folks have fun.

## 🎤 What You’re Doing as the Host

You’ll be the main person guiding the game:

* Read the questions out loud
* Listen to team answers
* Reveal answers on the screen (with help from the Game Runner)
* Keep the game moving
* Work with the **Moderator** to watch time and decide when to slow down or speed up

**You do not need to manage the game software or tech — that’s the Game Runner’s job.**

## 🎯 What’s the Goal?

To guess the most popular responses to each question based on a real SHS team survey. Points are based on how many people gave the same answer. The more common the answer, the higher the points!

> Example: If 42% of people said “coffee” is needed before starting the day, that answer is worth 42 points.

## 📦 Game Format

* **6 total questions** are pre-loaded in the Friendly Feud game.
* Depending on time and energy, you may only use **3–6 of them.** That’s totally fine.
* **4 teams** will be playing.
* Each question will be played one at a time with one team answering at a time.

## ✅ Standard Game Flow (per question)

1. **Choose a team to go first.**

   * Alternate teams across questions.

2. **Read the question out loud.**

   * Example: “Name something you need before starting your day.”

3. **The team gets to guess as many answers as they can until they get 3 wrong.**

   * Each incorrect guess earns an **X**.
   * If the answers are *very* hard to guess, feel free to allow **4 Xs** (Host’s call).

4. **If they don’t guess all answers:**

   * Each of the other 3 teams writes down **ONE guess** as a steal attempt.
   * The **team that writes down the highest remaining correct answer** gets the points.
   * If no team gets a correct answer, no one gets the points.

5. **Game Runner will reveal all the correct answers** on screen (you can read them aloud too).

6. **Move to the next question** and rotate starting teams.

## 🧠 Things to Watch For

* **Duplicate answers:** If a team repeats an answer that’s already been guessed, let them know it’s a repeat — but don’t count it as an X.

* **Similar answers:** Use judgment! If someone says “go for a walk” and the real answer is “take a walk,” that counts. The **Moderator** can help decide.

* **No correct answer during steal:** If no one writes down a correct answer, no team gets the steal.

* **Run short on time?** Ask the **Moderator** how much time is left and whether to keep going or end early.

## 🕹 Tips for a Great Host

* Keep the tone light — jokes, playfulness, and team spirit are welcome.
* Repeat the question once or twice to help teams think.
* Let the Game Runner know when you’re ready to move to the next question.
* If there’s confusion, check in with the Moderator.

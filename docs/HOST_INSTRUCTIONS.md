# SHS Family Feud – Host Instructions

Welcome! You’ve been chosen to host the SHS Family Feud–style department game — thank you! Don’t worry if you’ve never done this before — this guide will walk you through everything step-by-step.

This is a low-pressure, fun way to connect with your teammates. You don’t need to know tech or be a game show pro — just keep the energy up and help folks have fun.

## 🎤 What You’re Doing as the Host

You are the **game leader.** You will:

* Do not touch the laptop/TV during gameplay — Tech Support handles all clicking.
* Read each question out loud.
* Manage buzz-ins and keep track of which team goes first.
* Work with the **Moderator** to manage timing, handle judgment calls, and ensure points are tallied.
* Keep the energy fun and positive.

## ⚙️ Setup Before Starting

1. Tech Support will open [https://www.famf.app](https://www.famf.app) and load the `FamilyFeudSHS.json` file.
2. Tech Support will connect the laptop to the TV or projector and set up two windows (TV = Game Screen, Laptop = Host Controls).
4. Test the **egg buzzers** — make sure they clearly show which team buzzes first.
5. Have the **Moderator** ready with a timer and printed question sheet.

## 🏁 How the Normal Rounds Work

Each round follows this order:

### 1. Show the Question

Read the question on screen and give teams a moment to get ready. Once you finish reading, the **buzzers are live.**

### 2. Buzz-In

The first team to buzz gets to answer.

* If their answer is the **top answer**, they can **choose to play or pass.**
* If it’s not the top answer, go to the next team to buzz.
* If all teams have buzzed, the team with the **highest-ranking answer** plays.

### 3. Playing the Board

The playing team tries to guess the remaining answers on the board. **Tech Support reveals answers on the TV when you call them.**

* Each wrong answer earns an **X**.
* Three X’s = turn over.

### 4. Stealing

After 3 X’s, each of the other teams writes down **one steal guess.**

* If a steal guess matches a remaining answer → that team **wins the round’s points.**
* If no team gets a correct steal → the **original playing team keeps their points.**

### 5. End of Round

After the round:

* Ask Tech Support to reveal any unrevealed answers.
* **Sara tallies the total points** for that round.
* Announce which team won the round and the updated totals.

## ⚡ Bonus Round

The Bonus Round (Fast Money) is faster-paced and can be played at the end.

1. Choose two players (either from one team or the two leading teams).
2. Tech Support clicks the **Final Round** button to start each player's run.
3. Timers are defined in the uploaded `FamilyFeudSHS.json`. If a separate timer is needed, the **Moderator** keeps time on a phone.
4. You will ask **5 quick questions** (from the bonus section of the question sheet).
5. Designate a **scribe** to write down each answer as the player speaks. Do not enter answers during the timer.
6. When time ends, Tech Support enters the scribed answers into Friendly Feud.
7. Duplicate answers are **not allowed** — if a player repeats, tell them to try again.
8. Repeat for player 2, then Tech Support reveals points for all 5 answers.
9. The Moderator or Host tallies totals and announces the winner.

## 🧠 Things to Watch For

### Normal Rounds

* Similar answers (e.g., “Take a walk” vs “Go for a walk”) — count as correct.
* If all teams miss the steal, the playing team always keeps the points.
* Always have the Moderator confirm time and fairness calls.

### Bonus Round

* Duplicate answers → not allowed (ask for a new one).
* Moderator keeps the timer.
* Host reveals answers at the end.

## 🧾 End-of-Round Recap

After every question:

* Confirm the total points earned for that round.
* Ask **Sara** to tally and announce the cumulative totals.
* Keep the energy fun — celebrate each team’s progress!

---

## 🎉 Hosting Tips

* Keep it lighthearted — humor and cheering are encouraged.
* Read clearly and keep the pace moving.
* Use the Moderator’s cues on whether to move faster or slow down.
* If there’s confusion, pause and check the printed reference.

At the end of the game, announce:

* The **total points** for each team.
* The **winning team**.
* And finish with, “Thanks for playing SHS Family Feud!” 🎊

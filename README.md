# SHS Department Game: Family Feud Style

Welcome to the SHS Department Game Show Documentation!  
This repository makes it easy for anyone on the team to run our *Friendly Feud*‚Äìstyle department bonding game using the open-source platform [Friendly Feud](https://www.famf.app/docs/en/help).

Whether you're hosting, moderating, or supporting behind the scenes, these guides explain everything you need to know ‚Äî clearly, simply, and without needing prior experience.

## üß≠ Overview

- **Game Format:** Based on *Family Feud*, using the web tool [Friendly Feud](https://www.famf.app).  
- **Rounds:** Six normal questions plus one optional Bonus Round. Depending on time, play 3‚Äì6 questions.  
- **Teams:** Four teams total. Steals occur when the main team reaches three X‚Äôs ‚Äî other teams each write down one answer; if any is correct, that team steals the points. If none are correct, the playing team keeps their points.  
- **Roles:**
  - [Host](https://github.com/coolbass04/SHS-Family-Feud/blob/main/docs/HOST_INSTRUCTIONS.md) ‚Äì Leads the game, reads questions, keeps the energy going (does not click).  
  - [Tech Support](https://github.com/coolbass04/SHS-Family-Feud/blob/main/docs/TECH_SUPPORT.md) ‚Äì Sets up laptop+TV, runs two windows (TV = Game Screen, Laptop = Host Controls), and clicks to reveal answers when the Host calls them.  
  - [Moderator](https://github.com/coolbass04/SHS-Family-Feud/blob/main/docs/MODERATOR.md) ‚Äì Tracks time, monitors buzz-ins, judges answers, and helps with scoring fairness.  
  - [Sara / Scorekeeper](https://github.com/coolbass04/SHS-Family-Feud/blob/main/docs/GAME_OVERVIEW.md#at-a-glance) ‚Äì Tallies and announces total points each round.

## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Setup

- Use **one laptop connected to a TV or projector** to display the game.  
- Use **two browser windows** at [Friendly Feud](https://www.famf.app): TV shows **Open Game Window**; laptop shows **Host/Admin** controls.  
- **Tech Support** operates the controls (reveals answers on the Host‚Äôs cue). The **Host does not interact with the TV/computer** during gameplay.  
- Use **egg buzzers** for the initial question buzz-ins.  
- The Moderator tracks timing and manages judgment calls.  
- Print the `QUESTION_ANSWER_REFERENCE.md` as a manual backup sheet if needed.

---

## üßæ Scoring & Rounds

- Each answer is worth points based on real SHS survey results (scaled to total ~100 per question).  
- After each round, **Sara tallies the totals** and announces which team is leading.  
- The **Bonus Round** uses five rapid-fire questions ‚Äî duplicates aren‚Äôt allowed, and timing is strict (20 seconds per player).
